# Punk Beers
How to install:
Simply run

```
npm i && npm start
```

The project was built as a React example on how to fetch data from an API. I chose axios.get over fetch due to Node support.
I've played around with styled-components and React Hooks.
I've also implemented a feature-based structure, and also aimed to keep the code as clean as possible.
I've refactored the code into separate files based on logic and responsabilities.
I've customized the default look, feel and details that create-react-app started with to better match the project.

Also, I used a little pathing trick, to make the imports easier to read.
