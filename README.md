# Punk Beers
How to install:
Simply run

```
npm i && npm start
```

The project was built as React example on how to fetch data from an API. I chose axios.get over fetch due to Node support.

I've played around with styled-components and React Hooks.

I've implemented a feature-based structure, and also aimed to keep the code as clean as possible.

I've refactored the code into separate files based on logic and responsabilities.

Also, I used a little pathing trick, to make the imports easier to read.

I've customized the default look, feel and details that create-react-app started with to better match the project.
